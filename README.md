# Hanani's Guide to Front-end
This documentation is a personal learning journey in front-end development. Here, I gather a collection of articles, documentation, and videos related to various topics I'm studying. The aim is to create an open resource for others to learn and review these topics in a more organized manner. Additionally, it serves as a motivation for me to read and study more about each of these subjects.

Esta documentação é uma jornada pessoal de aprendizado no desenvolvimento front-end. Aqui, eu reúno uma coleção de artigos, documentações e vídeos relacionados a diferentes tópicos que estou estudando. O objetivo é criar um recurso aberto para que outras pessoas possam aprender e revisar esses tópicos de forma mais organizada. Além de servir para mim mesmo como uma maneira de se motivar a ler e estudar mais sobre cada um desses assuntos.

# What is HTTP?
HTTP is an application layer protocol used for communication between clients and servers, following a client-server model. It's a stateless protocol, meaning servers don't retain information between requests. But it's not only this.

# What is Domain Name and DNS?
Domain names, like 'google.com' or 'facebook.com,' provide user-friendly access to websites. The Domain Name System (DNS) translates these names into IP addresses.

# What is Browsers and How they work?
A web browser is a software tool that lets users access and view web content through a graphical interface. It communicates with web servers using protocols like HTTP and relies on DNS to translate domain names into IP addresses for web content retrieval.
